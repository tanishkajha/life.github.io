<h2>
    just because people are beieng bad to you , doesn,t mean you should sacrifice the same energy to them. 
    don,t go through that kind of effort . the best thinf you can do is to completely ignore them
    and foucs on what makes you netter .it,s hard ,but know that you deserve only good and positive vibes . 
    you were not born to embarace and express negativity . maybe the people around you might have brought that side 
    out of you , but naturally ypu,r nothing like those people . you,re way better.
